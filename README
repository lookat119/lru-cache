I was asked to make this (an lru cache) in an interview, and it seemed like a fun thing to finish off.

Upcoming improvements:
	not deleting / re-adding nodes for every get/set
	broader generalization

If you have questions or are thinking you want to use this (... :|) then contact me at carss.w@gmail.com

Thanks!
Wyatt
